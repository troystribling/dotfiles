Please:
- [ ] Make your pull request atomic, fixing one issue at a time unless there are many relevant issues that cannot be decoupled.
- [ ] Provide a test case & update the documentation under `site/docs/`
- [ ] Make lint and test pass. (Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test`)
- [ ] Make sure you have merged `master` into your branch. 
- [ ] Provide a concise title so that we can just copy it to our release note. 
  - Use imperative mood and present tense.
  - Mention relevant issues. (e.g., `#1`)
