                           *   tabIndex={-1}

                           * are going to be triggered when you try to select text.
                           * This is where this module comes in, it will prevent the callback from
                           * being triggered in a text selection event.
                           *
                           * To use it, just wrap your callback in a ignoreTextSelectionEvents call
