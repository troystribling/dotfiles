## 0.2.2 - More configuration
* Added setting for SCSS-style grouping (&__element) and possibility to change the grouping token (&)
* Added possibility to set output tokens before/after declarations (enables SASS-like indented style output)
* Removed classless elements from the output (caused more confusion than good)
* JSX support (dumb, just looking for className attribute as a fallback for class)

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Initial version
