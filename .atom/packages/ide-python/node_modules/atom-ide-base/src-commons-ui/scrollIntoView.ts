/**
 * Use these functions instead of `Element::scrollIntoView()` and
 * `Element::scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()`!
 *
 * We've had a recurring issue in Nuclide (e.g. T20028138) where the UI would shift, leaving part of
 * the workspace element offscreen and a blank area in the window. This was caused by called to the
 * native `scrollIntoView()` and `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` which, according to the spec, has two
 * potentially surprising behaviors:
 *
 * 1. [It scrolls every scrollable ancestor (not just the closest)][1], where
 * 2. "scrollable" is [explicitly defined][2] to include elements with `overflow: hidden`
 *
 * This is surprising because `overflow: hidden` is typically used to make elements *not
 * scrollable*.
 *
 * Once the `overflow: hidden` element is scrolled, the user has no way to return it to its original
 * position (as it has no scrollbars).
 *
 * Note that this API doesn't support smooth scrolling. If that becomes necessary, we'll need to
 * come up with a better fix.
 *
 * It's tempting to assume that using `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` would fix this issue, however, if
 * the window is small enough so that no amount of scrolling the desired scrollable element would
 * ever reveal the element you're trying to, the browser will keep scrolling ancestors.
