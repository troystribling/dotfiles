Originally based off of [JuliaLang/julia.tmBundle](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Julia.tmbundle), merged with new ideas from [language-julia](https://github.com/tpoisot/language-julia/blob/master/README.md) package.\n\n## Features:\n\n- Syntax highlighting\n- Snippets for common Julia keywords and constructs (see `snippets/language-julia.cson`)\n- Toggle folding of docstrings\n\n## Installation\n\nInstallation happens normally either through `apm install language-julia` or through the install section of the settings tab within Atom.\n\nNote: if you already have a different version of language-julia plugin installed (e.g. [this one](https://github.com/tpoisot/language-julia)), you would need to remove it first using `apm uninstall language-julia`\n\n## Recommended Extras\n\n* The [Latex Completions](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-latex-completions)\n  package provides support for unicode characters similarly to the Julia REPL.\n* The [Indent Detective](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-indent-detective) package will help you keep to the style guidelines when working on Base or packages.\n\n## Toggling docstrings\n\nTwo Atom commands are provided to toggle all docstrings or the docstring under the cursor: `language-julia:toggle-docstrings` and `language-julia:toggle-all-docstrings`. These are not assigned keys. Here is one example of adding these to keymaps using org-mode style keys:\n\n```\n'atom-text-editor[data-grammar=\"source julia\"]:not([mini])':\n  'tab':       'language-julia:toggle-docstrings'\n  'shift-tab': 'language-julia:toggle-all-docstrings'\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe love contributors. Here are the steps we have taken to develop on this package:\n\n1. Remove the official install of the package: `apm uninstall language-julia`\n2. Clone the repository somewhere we can remember: `git clone git@github.com:JuliaEditorSupport/atom-language-julia.git`\n3. Link the cloned package to `~/.atom` (enter the following from the root of the repo directory): `apm link .`\n4. Hack away!\n\nWhen new features are added, you should write specs to show that the package is behaving as expected. To run the specs you need to do the following:\n\n- Make sure you have the library's folder open in the current atom project.\n- Then open the command pallete and select `Window: Run package specs`. On OSX this key-binding is `ctrl+cmd+option+p`.\n\nThis should open up a new window with the spec results.\n\n#### Contributor list\n\n- Everyone who has helped with the [tmBundle](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Julia.tmbundle)\n- [See contributors](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/atom-language-julia/graphs/contributors)\n",
