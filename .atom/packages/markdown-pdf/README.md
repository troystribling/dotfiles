## [Markdown to PDF](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-pdf)

Convert markdown-formatted documents to pdf files without ever leaving Atom.

### Usage
Just focus the window containing your markdown file and use the `convert` command (`Packages > Markdown PDF > Convert`).

The output PDF will be styled similar to the markdown on `github.com`, as well as any [user styles](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#style-tweaks) you have added.

It will appear in the same directory as the Markdown you are converting, with the same name and a `.pdf` extension.

You can set parameters in the package's settings, such as page and border size.

##### My other Atom package

If you're using Atom to develop Atom, you could use a [devtools upgrade](https://github.com/travs/dev-tools-themes).
